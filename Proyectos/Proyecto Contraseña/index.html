        <h2 class="secondContainer_h2">How to create a Strong Password</h2>
        <div class="secondContainer_uls">
        <ul>

            <li class="secondContainer_li">1. Length Matters: A longer password provides greater security because it's more difficult for attackers
                to crack.
                Aim for a minimum of 12 characters, but longer passwords, such as 16 characters or more, are even
                better.
                A passphrase, like "MyDogLoves2RunInThePark," is an excellent example of a long, strong password.
            </li>
            <li class="secondContainer_li">
                2. Use a Mix of Characters: Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
                This diversity increases the complexity of your password. For example, transform "apple" into something
                stronger like "ApP!3$auce."
            </li>
            <li class="secondContainer_li">
            3. Avoid Common Words: Stay away from common words or phrases that are easily guessable. Avoid using words
            like "password," "letmein," or "admin." Hackers use automated tools to try these first.
            </li>
            <li class="secondContainer_li">
                4. Don't Use Personal Information: Never include easily obtainable personal information, like your name,
                birthdate, or common family member names. Such information is readily available through social media and
                other sources.
            </li>
            <li class="secondContainer_li">
                5. Passphrases: Passphrases are long and memorable. They are typically formed from a combination of
                unrelated words, numbers, and special characters. For instance, "Sunny@Beach1PalmTree!" is a strong and
                memorable passphrase.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="secondContainer_li">
                6. Unique and Unpredictable: Refrain from using easily recognizable patterns, such as "1234," "abcd," or
                sequential keyboard patterns like "qwerty." Make your password as random as possible.
            </li>
            <li class="secondContainer_li">
            7. Avoid Dictionary Words: Even if you substitute some letters with numbers or special characters, hackers
            have tools that can try variations of dictionary words. Instead, create entirely new combinations.
            </li>
            <li class="secondContainer_li">
                8. Change Regularly: Regularly updating your passwords is a good practice. Change them every 3-6 months,
                especially for critical accounts like email and banking. Frequent changes reduce the risk of long-term
                exposure.
            </li>
            <li class="secondContainer_li">
            9. Unique Passwords: It's crucial to use a different password for each account. If one account is
            compromised, using the same password for others makes them vulnerable too. A password manager can help you
            keep track of unique passwords for each account.
            </li>
            <li class="secondContainer_li">
                10. Use a Password Manager: Password managers generate, store, and autofill complex passwords for you.
                They can also help you keep track of numerous passwords for different accounts without the risk of
                forgetting them. Examples of popular password managers include LastPass, Dashlane, and 1Password.
